## Projects

### [Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/ITAXBOX/Mall-Customers-Segmentation)
- **Overview**: Customer segmentation is a critical marketing strategy that helps businesses identify distinct customer groups based on their behaviors and characteristics. This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Highlights**:
  - Identified distinct customer clusters for targeted marketing strategies.
  - Visualized spending patterns and income distribution across groups.
- **Future Work**:
  - Test with additional features and other clustering algorithms.
  - Deploy the model for real-time customer segmentation.

### [Water Potability Prediction using KNN and Decision Tree algorithms](https://github.com/ITAXBOX/Water-Potability-Prediction)
- **Overview**: This project aims to predict water potability using physicochemical parameters. It provides a machine learning-based approach for monitoring water quality efficiently.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Highlights**:
  - Applied KNN and Decision Tree algorithms, achieving up to 67.5% accuracy.
  - Balanced imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.
  - Identified key factors like pH and Hardness influencing water potability.
- **Future Work**:
  - Experiment with advanced algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
  - Collect more diverse datasets and deploy the model for real-world use.

 ### [Loan Eligibility Prediction using Decision Tree](https://github.com/ITAXBOX/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction)
- **Overview**: Automating loan eligibility decisions can save time and ensure consistency in financial institutions. This project builds a predictive model using a Decision Tree algorithm to determine whether applicants are eligible for home loans based on various parameters such as income, credit history, and property area.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE
- **Highlights**:
  - Achieved an initial accuracy of 74%, precision of 79%, recall of 82%, and F1-score of 80%.
  - Improved F1-score to 81.6% after hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.
  - Balanced the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance.
  - Created new features like Income-to-Loan Ratio to improve model performance.
  - Analyzed feature importance to identify key predictors like Credit History and Income-to-Loan Ratio.
- **Future Work**:
  - Experiment with ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for better performance.
  - Adjust decision thresholds to prioritize recall for ineligible applicants.
  - Incorporate additional data (e.g., employment history, detailed credit scores) to enhance predictive power.
  - Develop a web application or API for real-time loan eligibility predictions.
