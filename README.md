## Projects

### [Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/ITAXBOX/Mall-Customers-Segmentation)
- **Overview**: Customer segmentation is a critical marketing strategy that helps businesses identify distinct customer groups based on their behaviors and characteristics. This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Highlights**:
  - Identified distinct customer clusters for targeted marketing strategies.
  - Visualized spending patterns and income distribution across groups.
- **Future Work**:
  - Test with additional features and other clustering algorithms.
  - Deploy the model for real-time customer segmentation.

### [Water Potability Prediction using KNN and Decision Tree algorithms](https://github.com/ITAXBOX/Water-Potability-Prediction)
- **Overview**: This project aims to predict water potability using physicochemical parameters. It provides a machine learning-based approach for monitoring water quality efficiently.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Highlights**:
  - Applied KNN and Decision Tree algorithms, achieving up to 67.5% accuracy.
  - Balanced imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.
